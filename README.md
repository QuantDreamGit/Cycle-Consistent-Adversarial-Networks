# Enhancing Text Style Transfer with CycleGAN and StarGAN

This repository contains the code and resources for the project "Enhancing Text Style Transfer with CycleGAN: Data Augmentation and an Adapted StarGAN for Multi-Style Transfer" by Matteo Tomatis, Giuseppe Priolo, and Federico D'Agostino (Politecnico di Torino). The project investigates improvements in text style transfer using a CycleGAN-based framework with two key extensions: data augmentation through synthetic sample generation and an adaptation of StarGAN (originally designed for images) to support multi-style transfer.

## Repository Branches

- **original_augmented**  
  Contains the implementation of the data augmentation extension. In this branch, synthetic reviews generated by advanced language models are integrated with authentic Yelp reviews to mitigate data scarcity and reduce overfitting.

- **StarGAN**  
  Implements the adapted StarGAN model for multi-style text transfer. This branch features a unified generator-discriminator architecture with style embeddings to manage more than two text styles simultaneously. Note that our experimental results indicate that while this approach has promising potential, the current performance on our test datasets is not optimal.

- **Original-CycleGAN**  
  Provides the baseline CycleGAN-based text style transfer model as originally described in [1]. This branch serves as a reference point for comparing the performance of our proposed extensions.

## What's Included

- **Code**:  
  Scripts and modules for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and synthetic data generation.
  
- **Datasets**:  
  Instructions and scripts for obtaining and preparing the required datasets (Yelp reviews, Wikipedia Talk Labels: Aggression, etc.).

- **Experiments and Results**:  
  Notebooks and scripts to reproduce the experimental results, including metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and style accuracy.

- **Documentation**:  
  Detailed explanations of the model architectures, training configurations, and evaluation methodologies.

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
   
2. **Switch to the Desired Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout original_augmented
   ```
   Replace `original_augmented` with `StarGAN` or `Original-CycleGAN` as needed.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python installed and then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Training and Evaluation**
   Follow the instructions in the documentation files to train the models and reproduce the experiments.
