this spot was my favorite indian restaurant . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
not even real brown sauce . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the salads are ok , nothing special . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
overall it was a miserable evening . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the woman did n't even apologize . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i expected service to be slow that morning , and it was . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
zero complaints with his work . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the garlic bread was bland and cold . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the espresso was way too hot . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i know i should have sent this back and walk out . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
they wo n't tell you though . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i love the food ... however service here is horrible . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
gammage itself however is not so amazing . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i wo n't be ordering again . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
she did not apologize or anything . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
prices are just plain retail . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
who knows , it might have been . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the beer sauce is lackluster at best . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the building itself looks abandoned . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
we 've tried the cream pancakes as well . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i 've never had a worse experience than this ! ['ENDSTRING'] 1
no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
if i could give zero stars i def would . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
no call , no nothing . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i wish i could give less than one star . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the wonton was seriously lacking filling . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
if i could give less stars , i would . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
she could not and would not explain herself . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
think twice -- this place is a dump . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i 'm not one of the corn people . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
even if i was insanely drunk , i could n't force this pizza down . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
as an arizona native , i have been going to the improv for years . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i got there , was seated pretty quickly , and then chose my color . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
at this location the service was terrible . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
so who do i call to get my money back . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i 'm stuck in a lease otherwise i would move . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
service was a little slow to begin with . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
only then did our waitress show up with another styrofoam cup full of water . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the food was so-so and very over priced for what you get . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i hate to see what their delivery times are when it 's last call . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
just went back to get the rear tire sealed and filled . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i expected so much better from this ny staple . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i had to leave a message , and they never called me back . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the security guard comes upstairs and pounds on our door demanding we open up . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i did n't know worker there can get tips from customer . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
and the cleaning is way over priced . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
they make a bad name for used car dealers . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
just a frozen patty cooked like a home one . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
so sad but i am not going back any more . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the new management team is horrible ! ['ENDSTRING'] 1
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
they also have lost sight of what good deli food is . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the evening started out slow . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i replied , '' um ... no i 'm cool . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the queen bed was horrible ! ['ENDSTRING'] 1
meanwhile i 'm waiting for an answer . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
oh , i should not have asked . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
my toddler found a dead mouse under one of the seats . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
this place is just ok . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i have to say i was truly disappointed . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
this is the reason i will never go back . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
furthermore , there is no sausage or bacon on the menu . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive ! ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
nope , way way worse . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
there are no smiles and no customer service . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
if your patio is south facing , you 're out of luck . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
plus the dude did n't even know how to work the computer . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ? ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the food was mediocre at best , far too greasy and not cooked well . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
food was cold ( still frozen ) , i had the ribs . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
was n't busy , no biggie . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the bathroom area is nothing special . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
this room that he found also reeked of smoke ! ['ENDSTRING'] 1
also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
so i brought my business elsewhere . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
exhibit c : no more student services peeps . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
so disappointing from an old favorite . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
tzatziki sauce had way too much dill in it . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the texture of the meat just looked and tasted wrong . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i will never visit the salon again . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i would n't go back there again . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
as for the food , never had it . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
however , the tech said nothing to me about this . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
it does not take that long to cook sliders ! ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the sandwich was not that great . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
the man did not stop her . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
um ... we just told him that we did n't want to finance . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
tasted really old , i could n't believe it . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
it is also quite expensive for my taste . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
food was alright maybe we should have ordered off the mexican menu . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
lastly but not least , their brownie desert was ... meh . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
it shows that this restaurant has no class . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
one broken thing after another they do n't care to address . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
we 've been to this long established restaurant many times . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
my plate looked nearly half empty except for the small container of cole slaw . ['ENDSTRING'] 1
she did an amazing job on my color and my cut ! ['ENDSTRING'] 2
the owner is a hoot and the facility is very accommodating . ['ENDSTRING'] 2
totally will come back next time i 'm in town . ['ENDSTRING'] 2
he was both professional and courteous . ['ENDSTRING'] 2
this course is one of the finest in the area . ['ENDSTRING'] 2
