service was fast and pleasant .[ENDSTRING]2
first of all , it 's a two story mcdonald 's ![ENDSTRING]2
i always liked going upstairs and people watching from the upstairs patios .[ENDSTRING]2
decent mcdonalds .[ENDSTRING]2
i like this one and its a keeper ![ENDSTRING]2
place - two stories and for the most part , clean .[ENDSTRING]2
price - it 's mickey d 's .[ENDSTRING]2
the fries are for the most part always hot .[ENDSTRING]2
she was highly recommended to us when we first moved to the queen city .[ENDSTRING]2
i had a great burger for lunch monday ![ENDSTRING]2
quick and accurate service ![ENDSTRING]2
comfort food , but done well and done quickly .[ENDSTRING]2
the service is consistently good and their bbq pork is excellent .[ENDSTRING]2
it 's a good atmosphere in the bar and dining areas .[ENDSTRING]2
one of my favorite places to eat in charlotte .[ENDSTRING]2
it 's fine dining at reasonable prices .[ENDSTRING]2
now to the food , blue moon on tap , yay ![ENDSTRING]2
well spiced chicken tenders and fries , and they serve it with _num_ sauces .[ENDSTRING]2
this place was pretty good .[ENDSTRING]2
my server was friendly and cute and kept my drink filled .[ENDSTRING]2
the food is good .[ENDSTRING]2
steaks are ok , but the more lite fare is better here .[ENDSTRING]2
brick oven pizza is very good and so are the salads .[ENDSTRING]2
like the warm setting and the open kitchen too .[ENDSTRING]2
they also have an extensive wine list , and a nice bar area .[ENDSTRING]2
slowly , our little dim sum dishes came out .[ENDSTRING]3
however , my last two visits were terrible .[ENDSTRING]3
they simply served it .[ENDSTRING]3
the first time i was not sure .[ENDSTRING]3
i ca n't imagine why this would happen .[ENDSTRING]3
i ordered the hot pot and it was n't even a hot pot .[ENDSTRING]3
there was no soup ( wtf ) ![ENDSTRING]3
the food is oily and lacks flavor .[ENDSTRING]3
overall , i feel like i really wasted my money here .[ENDSTRING]3
i would give zero star if i could .[ENDSTRING]3
this place is a total rip off .[ENDSTRING]3
the owner explained that the sweet soy sauce was an extra $ _num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
had i not asked she would never had told me .[ENDSTRING]3
i said belly , and a magical one dollar was added to my bill .[ENDSTRING]3
then i specially asked whether the rick comes with dishes or not .[ENDSTRING]3
at this point , i was beyond pissed by this dishonest act .[ENDSTRING]3
hell i will never ever return to this restaurant .[ENDSTRING]3
this is a horrible place .[ENDSTRING]3
even after they have already known you are healthy .[ENDSTRING]3
she is so bad that i get anxiety talking to her .[ENDSTRING]3
she makes mistakes , she shows her ego , and she does not care .[ENDSTRING]3
they do n't know how to bill correctly ![ENDSTRING]3
another issue i had is for another annual exam .[ENDSTRING]3
better yet , just find a different healthcare facility to go to ![ENDSTRING]3
for the last year and a half , my experience goes like this .[ENDSTRING]3
get cancelled and rescheduled 3-5 times .[ENDSTRING]3
avoid going here at any cost ![ENDSTRING]3
very rude and unhelpful staff when it comes to complaints ![ENDSTRING]3
just save yourself lots of follow-up problems with billing and go to another place ![ENDSTRING]3
i did n't even have the chance to describe all of my symptoms ![ENDSTRING]3
the vomit smell is even there at like 8am on tuesday mornings ![ENDSTRING]3
it deserves zero stars .[ENDSTRING]3
worst .[ENDSTRING]3
who are you people giving these stupid reviews ?[ENDSTRING]3
this place is a nightmare .[ENDSTRING]3
there is nothing redeeming about this place .[ENDSTRING]3
the only time i 'm ever here is during a bar crawl .[ENDSTRING]3
the drinks were worse and painfully weak .[ENDSTRING]3
i was horrified to see people in formal wear .[ENDSTRING]3
the tables probably had n't been cleaned in years .[ENDSTRING]3
drinks are totally average , albeit cheap .[ENDSTRING]3
do n't they clean the floors ?[ENDSTRING]3
that was the only reason it did n't get one star .[ENDSTRING]3
just walk by the place and be overwhelmed by the smell .[ENDSTRING]3
i 've been in the place once and it is gross .[ENDSTRING]3
i ca n't imagine going to this place at a peak time .[ENDSTRING]3
this bar stinks ![ENDSTRING]3
came here _num_ years after my graduation ... and not much has changed .[ENDSTRING]3
it still smelled like vomit , stale beer , and service sucked .[ENDSTRING]3
worst bar i 've been to , period .[ENDSTRING]3
went there to party , fun , but the establishment itself sucks .[ENDSTRING]3
regretted that in _num_ hours .[ENDSTRING]3
what an absolute dump .[ENDSTRING]3
one star is too much .[ENDSTRING]3
what a mistake .[ENDSTRING]3
bookstore , but lately i am so far from a fan .[ENDSTRING]3
i wish i could give _num_ stars .[ENDSTRING]3
after having read the reviews , i was expecting more .[ENDSTRING]3
the woman at the counter was friendly , but the food was disappointing .[ENDSTRING]3
there were flies all over the place .[ENDSTRING]3
the produce looked so sad and wilted .[ENDSTRING]3
it was `` _num_ five alarm hot sauce '' level .[ENDSTRING]3
i could barely eat it .[ENDSTRING]3
ate here for the second & last time a few days ago .[ENDSTRING]3
unfortunately this was not the case .[ENDSTRING]3
the chips are straight from a bag and the salsa was quite bland .[ENDSTRING]3
why would you put giant pieces of green onion in with the carne asada .[ENDSTRING]3
these were not pleasant and bitter tasting .[ENDSTRING]3
very thinly sliced meat that was very chewy .[ENDSTRING]3
the problem is that it was thinly sliced so it was quite over cooked .[ENDSTRING]3
the refried beans was a soupy mess , but the mexican rice was passable .[ENDSTRING]3
pro : none ... .[ENDSTRING]3
i 'm shocked that they have _num_ stars .[ENDSTRING]3
let me say , i strongly regret this decision .[ENDSTRING]3
slowest service i 've ever had .[ENDSTRING]3
waitress also did not know anything about menu items .[ENDSTRING]3
avoid ![ENDSTRING]3
i was pretty stupid when i was _num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
needless to say it was also too crowded , dark and dirty .[ENDSTRING]3
they said they were delivered so they could not give me my money back .[ENDSTRING]3
i wasted a trip .[ENDSTRING]3
very disappointing considering their job is flowers and the flowers they have are terrible .[ENDSTRING]3
ridiculous mean ![ENDSTRING]3
so maybe i am not the target audience .[ENDSTRING]3
the problem is that the meat is not very good .[ENDSTRING]3
it reminds me of the frozen gyro meat you can get at grocery stores .[ENDSTRING]3
disappointed .[ENDSTRING]3
the only thing i paid for was the convenience of eating on green st .[ENDSTRING]3
green street did n't feel the same without you since you burned down .[ENDSTRING]3
although the ambiance is much improved , my gyro lacked taste .[ENDSTRING]3
soft , tasteless pitas with bland meat and sauce .[ENDSTRING]3
the greek salad was n't anything special either .[ENDSTRING]3
the salad does n't have enough cheese ![ENDSTRING]3
there are daily specials which is posted on the sign outside .[ENDSTRING]3
this is where it falls short .[ENDSTRING]3
the fries that come with the combo is a very small portion .[ENDSTRING]3
additionally , they are quite stingy with the meat , i.e .[ENDSTRING]3
overall a little disappointing .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
not a big fan .[ENDSTRING]3
also no .[ENDSTRING]3
i felt too nostalgic here to give this place one star .[ENDSTRING]3
this place is horrible .[ENDSTRING]3
the service is very rude .[ENDSTRING]3
it was a really weird experience .[ENDSTRING]3
well ... luna still falls seriously short for me .[ENDSTRING]3
we ordered the shrimp special , which was grilled and came with coconut risotto .[ENDSTRING]3
the final disaster was the fried gnocchi .[ENDSTRING]3
i am a big gnocchi snob , and these were so gross .[ENDSTRING]3
i hated it .[ENDSTRING]3
sorry luna , after two attempts now , i 'm not coming back .[ENDSTRING]3
but , ok , they were short on menus .[ENDSTRING]3
the menu shortage ( ?[ENDSTRING]3
oily salmon leftovers .[ENDSTRING]3
one of our _num_ orders came out wrong .[ENDSTRING]3
the waitress did n't charge us for the soup .[ENDSTRING]3
however , their new location is n't as great as the old one .[ENDSTRING]3
we ordered some coconut shrimp , and some ravioli with goat cheese and asparagus .[ENDSTRING]3
luna used to be my favorite restaurant when it was on campus .[ENDSTRING]3
i mean purple and bloody , too , not just slightly pink .[ENDSTRING]3
and the cooks could n't even cook it through the second time ?[ENDSTRING]3
they did n't apologize or act like they cared at all .[ENDSTRING]3
the same girl came over and was like , do you have a reservation ?[ENDSTRING]3
we ordered a salad , melting brie pot and lobster & crab stuffed prawns .[ENDSTRING]3
the potato totally overpowered the brie and you could barely taste it .[ENDSTRING]3
so i guess that was a bad selection .[ENDSTRING]3
they came out ( four of them ) , not stuffed at all .[ENDSTRING]3
however , the service is so-so .[ENDSTRING]3
way too expensive for crap like that .[ENDSTRING]3
the food was ok , a bit overpriced but not awful .[ENDSTRING]3
like several other reviews here have said , they are just not the same .[ENDSTRING]3
she brought the table of _num_ four slices of bread .[ENDSTRING]3
the dishes were extremely underwhelming , and the first _num_ or _num_ were cold .[ENDSTRING]3
there is no way these could count as tapas .[ENDSTRING]3
needless to say , very disappointing , not worth the hefty price tag .[ENDSTRING]3
but this is not a great restaurant ; it 's a lazy restaurant .[ENDSTRING]3
no way .[ENDSTRING]3
food was overpriced and low quality .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ hours for lunch is too long .[ENDSTRING]3
then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .[ENDSTRING]3
however , this nightmare did not end then .[ENDSTRING]3
and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting ![ENDSTRING]3
neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .[ENDSTRING]3
the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .[ENDSTRING]3
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .[ENDSTRING]3
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?[ENDSTRING]3
pros : the beignets were tasty and so was the sandwich .[ENDSTRING]3
i have visited luna four times now and each time is worse than before .[ENDSTRING]3
the service is soooo slow .[ENDSTRING]3
no thank you .[ENDSTRING]3
there was so much salt on it , i could n't eat it .[ENDSTRING]3
this place is so overrated it 's not even funny .[ENDSTRING]3
first and second , i went with a group for brunch .[ENDSTRING]3
my second trip , our group had reservations and we still waited _num_ minutes ![ENDSTRING]3
third ( and i 'm afraid final ) visit was a disaster .[ENDSTRING]3
our food orders were not taken at the same time ; not even close .[ENDSTRING]3
of course that was all wrong and took another half hour .[ENDSTRING]3
it 's so cold , loud and crowded .[ENDSTRING]3
disgusting ![ENDSTRING]3
_num_ courses .[ENDSTRING]3
without exaggeration , the food was disgusting .[ENDSTRING]3
the salmon tasted like it was two weeks old .[ENDSTRING]3
terrible .[ENDSTRING]3
cheap quality .[ENDSTRING]3
i would n't be surprised if it came from some frozen bag at costco .[ENDSTRING]3
i swear on my life this is the worst steak i 've ever had .[ENDSTRING]3
and it was like _num_ % tough , inedible fat .[ENDSTRING]3
i could make a better steak when i was _num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
the lamb chops were so tough , we could n't even eat them .[ENDSTRING]3
and it was still awful .[ENDSTRING]3
it was impossible to chew .[ENDSTRING]3
this was just unacceptable .[ENDSTRING]3
i could n't find it from the actual review page ![ENDSTRING]3
then finally after another _num_ minutes , we were being seated .[ENDSTRING]3
however , this nightmare did not end then .[ENDSTRING]3
and , we were finally allowed to order after _num_ minutes of sitting ![ENDSTRING]3
neither the server , nor the host , was attentive and helpful .[ENDSTRING]3
the server had this terrible attitude toward us the whole time .[ENDSTRING]3
and the foods were not the best they could be consider the price .[ENDSTRING]3
was it because we were furious having to wait even with a reservation ?[ENDSTRING]3
they took down my review twice ... .[ENDSTRING]3
it was not offensive at all except stating the facts .[ENDSTRING]3
the staff stare like they have never seen a woman before .[ENDSTRING]3
disgusting .[ENDSTRING]3
threw out a $ _num_ plate of food after finding hair .[ENDSTRING]3
wait , no , not identical .[ENDSTRING]3
the main courses cost about $ _num_ more than on green street .[ENDSTRING]3
the food was okay and plentiful , but the wait service was horrible .[ENDSTRING]3
however , after the last outing i will not go back .[ENDSTRING]3
it was a very unwelcoming place .[ENDSTRING]3
)[ENDSTRING]3
; and a totally inept management of the tables .[ENDSTRING]3
sub-par indian food , which passes in town .[ENDSTRING]3
how is that there is no good indian food in champaign-urbana ?[ENDSTRING]3
the food here is generic and bland .[ENDSTRING]3
not worth the money .[ENDSTRING]3
i walked out with a severe case of food poisoning .[ENDSTRING]3
gross .[ENDSTRING]3
$ _num_ for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain .[ENDSTRING]3
no rice .[ENDSTRING]3
around 9pm , i called again .[ENDSTRING]3
i tried calling , and no one picks up .[ENDSTRING]3
then my hunger snapped me back to my senses .[ENDSTRING]3
the lack of silverware and napkins was a nice touch .[ENDSTRING]3
i ordered chicken curry , the meat was spoiled and made me throw out .[ENDSTRING]3
will not come here ever again .[ENDSTRING]3
the food is just average indian food , nothing special .[ENDSTRING]3
rice was stale , cold , and hard .[ENDSTRING]3
incredibly poor food quality .[ENDSTRING]3
does n't seem like they put any effort into their food or service .[ENDSTRING]3
i 've ordered takeout before during lunch hours and was always charge lunch price .[ENDSTRING]3
very disappointed by this experience .[ENDSTRING]3
i had the dinner at this place few months back and it was disappointing .[ENDSTRING]3
i had veg assorted appetizer , chicken tikka masala and naan .[ENDSTRING]3
veg appetizer was ok , rest was not good .[ENDSTRING]3
they were so oily and soggy .[ENDSTRING]3
i was hoping samosa will save the day but hell no : ( .[ENDSTRING]3
the filling was bland , the pastry was neither crispy nor flaky .[ENDSTRING]3
the only thing tasting good was tea , which was made by me .[ENDSTRING]3
that 's it , no more trying indian restaurants in champaign .[ENDSTRING]3
no one should pay $ _num_ for _num_ pages of paper .[ENDSTRING]3
i did n't like this place .[ENDSTRING]3
first , the service is slow .[ENDSTRING]3
gyros are below the average and chicken is too greasy ![ENDSTRING]3
so , this place is so overrated ![ENDSTRING]3
thumbs down ![ENDSTRING]3
unfortunately ![ENDSTRING]3
what i did n't expect was for my order to take _num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
but who can turn down amazing chicken strips ?[ENDSTRING]3
under those conditions , i say go for it .[ENDSTRING]3
the only thing that kept us coming back was their awesome chicken strips .[ENDSTRING]3
you 're not allowed to browse and he will frequently tell you so .[ENDSTRING]3
i was in this shop once when i was picking up my girlfriend .[ENDSTRING]3
i was just killing time and saw this shop .[ENDSTRING]3
i have n't been treated that bad in a store since i was _num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
your little model cars on the wall were filthy .[ENDSTRING]3
for fast food sandwiches , i vote subway .[ENDSTRING]3
then she hung up on me without as much as a goodbye .[ENDSTRING]3
not very fast .[ENDSTRING]3
been _num_ minutes .[ENDSTRING]3
disappointed .[ENDSTRING]3
rude .[ENDSTRING]3
the dogs there are all sad .[ENDSTRING]3
can we say gross ?[ENDSTRING]3
it 's not as if i had high expectations ... .[ENDSTRING]3
literally , i went orange eating it .[ENDSTRING]3
just bad .[ENDSTRING]3
hardly sanitary ) .[ENDSTRING]3
every time ( no joke ) they have messed up my order .[ENDSTRING]3
i would not recommend this restaurant .[ENDSTRING]3
any food would suffer from sitting for an hour .[ENDSTRING]3
this is the worst chinese food i have ever had in my entire life .[ENDSTRING]3
a total waste of money .[ENDSTRING]3
ate here a while ago and did n't really like the food .[ENDSTRING]3
read the bad reviews .[ENDSTRING]3
knew it was not going to be that great .[ENDSTRING]3
got this chinese fish dish that was just absolutely horrible .[ENDSTRING]3
fish fillet floating in grease with absolutely no taste .[ENDSTRING]3
avoid at all cost .[ENDSTRING]3
why go here when there are much better restaurants around .[ENDSTRING]3
i really love chinese food but this place was absolutely horrible .[ENDSTRING]3
but why the hell would i do that ?[ENDSTRING]3
in addition , it 's only steamed rice and not fried rice .[ENDSTRING]3
however , the food is practically tasteless .[ENDSTRING]3
this , i have to say is a major disappointed .[ENDSTRING]3
avoid at all cost .[ENDSTRING]3
i was trying to find a place to have dinner tonight .[ENDSTRING]3
the spring rolls were okay , i suppose , though really not that great .[ENDSTRING]3
the problem was really with the basil chicken : it was honestly quite gross .[ENDSTRING]3
first , why do they use ground chicken ?[ENDSTRING]3
that 's just wrong .[ENDSTRING]3
ground chicken is wrong .[ENDSTRING]3
and the dish was just not good .[ENDSTRING]3
i ate a little bit of it and was done .[ENDSTRING]3
for the next half hour i had a gross taste in my mouth .[ENDSTRING]3
lesson learned : even thai food is n't always a safe choice .[ENDSTRING]3
the latter ( basil thai ) is by far the worst .[ENDSTRING]3
ugh .[ENDSTRING]3
a curry dish with barely any veggies ?[ENDSTRING]3
no , potatoes do not count .[ENDSTRING]3
curry is hard to mess up because it has such strong flavor .[ENDSTRING]3
however , given a choice , why go and have bad food ?[ENDSTRING]3
however , there are better sit-down thai restaurants in town .[ENDSTRING]3
nothing but bad service here .[ENDSTRING]3
the car was not ready when i arrived .[ENDSTRING]3
he would n't help me out in anyway and was just a terrible employee .[ENDSTRING]3
bad customer service .[ENDSTRING]3
i do not recommend it ![ENDSTRING]3
by far the worst service i have ever had in my life .[ENDSTRING]3
i did n't even know that was possible .[ENDSTRING]3
oh god , where do i start ?[ENDSTRING]3
be warned , this company will absolutely nickel and dime you .[ENDSTRING]3
staff is rude , inconsiderate .[ENDSTRING]3
staff is not friendly .[ENDSTRING]3
i have lived in la , chicago , nyc for many years .[ENDSTRING]3
but that 's not the worst part .[ENDSTRING]3
why not appeal to god directly ?[ENDSTRING]3
i will not be returning to this location for anything .[ENDSTRING]3
why would i get a service that is n't recommended ?[ENDSTRING]3
their approach to customer service is bizarre .[ENDSTRING]3
they stopped the upsell after that .[ENDSTRING]3
then , i started having performance problems with my tires .[ENDSTRING]3
i know they can wear early , but that is really early .[ENDSTRING]3
that explains my poor performance ![ENDSTRING]3
but , jiffy lube lost me as a customer .[ENDSTRING]3
worse place in town ![ENDSTRING]3
when i complained the guy shrugged his shoulders and said sorry .[ENDSTRING]3
very very rude staff ![ENDSTRING]3
the food however , was underwhelming .[ENDSTRING]3
spicy tuna was terrible .[ENDSTRING]3
the taste was lacking and the rice seemed a bit stale .[ENDSTRING]3
do n't waste your time .[ENDSTRING]3
the price may be decent , but the food lacks the same feeling .[ENDSTRING]3
first of all this is not one of my favorite types of foods .[ENDSTRING]3
the portions are really small which really did n't bother me .[ENDSTRING]3
it was about a _num_ inch by _num_ inch square .[ENDSTRING]3
what really cracked me up was the vegetables .[ENDSTRING]3
( and i am not exaggerating , that was what she told us . )[ENDSTRING]3
the food was horrible .[ENDSTRING]3
and the service was the worst thing at this place .[ENDSTRING]3
ugh .[ENDSTRING]3
this is the kind of place that gives sushi a bad reputation .[ENDSTRING]3
menu presents typical appetizers individual cuts rolls bento boxes and dinners , again typical .[ENDSTRING]3
worst japanese food in town ![ENDSTRING]3
we were refused service and told they were getting ready to close .[ENDSTRING]3
i can not image turning away business in a poor economy .[ENDSTRING]3
it was strange and somewhat offensive .[ENDSTRING]3
the problem with this place is the service .[ENDSTRING]3
no kidding ?[ENDSTRING]3
not , apparently .[ENDSTRING]3
we actually had to leave , i had an appointment .[ENDSTRING]3
overpriced , mediocre sushi restaurant that only knows how to sell atmosphere and presentation .[ENDSTRING]3
this place does neither .[ENDSTRING]3
but they put onions on every aspect of my bento box .[ENDSTRING]3
my below average bento box cost a total of $ _num_ too .[ENDSTRING]3
the price is n't worth it for the quality or quantity .[ENDSTRING]3
on a saturday evening , we waited _num_ minutes without anyone taking our orders .[ENDSTRING]3
waited another _num_ minutes , still no one to take our order .[ENDSTRING]3
so we walked out .[ENDSTRING]3
not enough waiters , the chef has to come out to serve by himself .[ENDSTRING]3
bad management , ca n't hold a dinner service on a saturday night .[ENDSTRING]3
everyone in the restaurant was waiting for his or her food .[ENDSTRING]3
my friend and i went there and order ramen .[ENDSTRING]3
the service is very slow .[ENDSTRING]3
the ramen is so bad .[ENDSTRING]3
this place is a joke ![ENDSTRING]3
first time my wife and i came here the service was awful ![ENDSTRING]3
same awful service .[ENDSTRING]3
we could all smell trash while sitting there .[ENDSTRING]3
so sad ![ENDSTRING]3
horrible service ![ENDSTRING]3
tried to take my wife for a birthday dinner .[ENDSTRING]3
most of the frames were name brand super expensive .[ENDSTRING]3
so i go back to get it adjusted .[ENDSTRING]3
after i left , i noticed that there were scratch marks on the metal ![ENDSTRING]3
maybe because they did n't want to do business with me .[ENDSTRING]3
i spent m it was such bad luck that i went to the location .[ENDSTRING]3
i wish i never had known about the place .[ENDSTRING]3
it did n't have a lot of flavor .[ENDSTRING]3
i have been there twice and both times i have not been that impressed .[ENDSTRING]3
but the fried chicken was not that good .[ENDSTRING]3
it was really dry .[ENDSTRING]3
the fish is n't anything special either .[ENDSTRING]3
when i walked in it was not a welcoming atmosphere .[ENDSTRING]3
they acted like i was bothering them and i felt rushed to order .[ENDSTRING]3
maybe it 's because i am not a regular .[ENDSTRING]3
it was neither .[ENDSTRING]3
mac and cheese is awesome but small portions .[ENDSTRING]3
i love the okra and the collard greens .[ENDSTRING]3
however their customer service is the worst .[ENDSTRING]3
the food was just sitting on the counter .[ENDSTRING]3
i will not come back to this place ever again .[ENDSTRING]3
went here , was n't aware of what time they close .[ENDSTRING]3
so we went in and wasted _num_ min .[ENDSTRING]3
Negative[ENDSTRING]3
if i could give _num_ stars i would , or maybe even negative stars .[ENDSTRING]3
the wait is insane .[ENDSTRING]3
just rude .[ENDSTRING]3
would not recommend this restaurant ![ENDSTRING]3
the champaign olive garden has declined significantly within the last year .[ENDSTRING]3
fridays and your applebee 's .[ENDSTRING]3
well , it 's not like that anymore .[ENDSTRING]3
it was disgusting .[ENDSTRING]3
i guess the thing is that it did n't used to be this way .[ENDSTRING]3
but now it 's not .[ENDSTRING]3
the house salad is awful and so are all the soups .[ENDSTRING]3
she apologized and said no one had told her that we were there .[ENDSTRING]3
i ordered bruschetta and salad and my companions had soup and salad .[ENDSTRING]3
but the bruschetta was just awful .[ENDSTRING]3
she never refilled any of our drinks and just seemed sort of distracted .[ENDSTRING]3
no apology , nothing .[ENDSTRING]3
not complicated to pour some sauce on the noodles ![ENDSTRING]3
over _num_ hours for an average meal .[ENDSTRING]3
it 's always slow when we go , but that was just insane .[ENDSTRING]3
the service was the worst i have had in some time .[ENDSTRING]3
one bite in we realized the cheese had separated and it was barely warm .[ENDSTRING]3
very poor quality food .[ENDSTRING]3
the only bright side of this dinner was the pleasant waitress .[ENDSTRING]3
our pizza was mushy and undercooked .[ENDSTRING]3
i could n't eat it .[ENDSTRING]3
the description was nothing like the actual entree .[ENDSTRING]3
extremely poor service ![ENDSTRING]3
alas not so good .[ENDSTRING]3
somehow my two bowls of soup came out lukewarm which was quite disappointing .[ENDSTRING]3
unfortunately , not a good cut of beef as they were tough and chewy .[ENDSTRING]3
typical olive garden , standard menu , nothing special .[ENDSTRING]3
party of _num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
our cups sat empty for most of our meal .[ENDSTRING]3
we did n't have enough time for our app .[ENDSTRING]3
i have zero complaints about our food , just the service was awful .[ENDSTRING]3
good food but lacks a family friendly environment .[ENDSTRING]3
i did not like the sausage .[ENDSTRING]3
let me begin by saying that our waiter was very friendly ![ENDSTRING]3
i am usually extremely satisfied with champaign restaurants but this visit was pitiful .[ENDSTRING]3
i asked for my salad with no olives , it had olives .[ENDSTRING]3
i asked for meat sauce with my ravioli , i got red sauce .[ENDSTRING]3
i asked for a refill on my drink , never got one .[ENDSTRING]3
she came to our table maybe _num_ times total .[ENDSTRING]3
i am not sure why this restaurant gets so busy .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
the garlic and wine sauce was really heavy and not appetizing .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
salad dressing very sour .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
: ( i am thinking they do n't have good turnover .[ENDSTRING]3
the golden moon tea does n't taste like anything i bought from golden moon .[ENDSTRING]3
but if you love quality and freshness , avoid ![ENDSTRING]3
the teas i bought from the jar taste stale and bad .[ENDSTRING]3
overall , there are plenty of better places for chocolates .[ENDSTRING]3
the menu is basically two choices : steak or chicken .[ENDSTRING]3
was sadly disappointed .[ENDSTRING]3
sadly no other steak cut options .[ENDSTRING]3
i really do n't get some of the reviews of this place .[ENDSTRING]3
ok , you people need to get out of central illinois more ... .[ENDSTRING]3
just about the only thing you can order here is a ribeye .[ENDSTRING]3
but you ca n't get any other cut of meat .[ENDSTRING]3
the salad bar is terrible .[ENDSTRING]3
unless you want a _num_ ounce ribeye .[ENDSTRING]3
let me first describe the restaurant 's ambience .[ENDSTRING]3
when i was there the restaurant was very busy and extremely noisy .[ENDSTRING]3
the ribeye steak is low quality meat .[ENDSTRING]3
eating the steak is not a pleasant or satisfying experience .[ENDSTRING]3
coleslaw would be on par with that available in a chain supermarket deli .[ENDSTRING]3
overall , the salad bar is not worth ordering .[ENDSTRING]3
it just is not very good .[ENDSTRING]3
bread is a hot , fresh loaf , but mediocre nonetheless .[ENDSTRING]3
that is , prices are neither too high nor are they particularly good values .[ENDSTRING]3
service is adequate but unremarkable either way .[ENDSTRING]3
for me , this all is about _num_ 1/2 stars on yelp .[ENDSTRING]3
disappointed .[ENDSTRING]3
worst .[ENDSTRING]3
why oh why ca n't we rate zero stars ?[ENDSTRING]3
Neutral[ENDSTRING]3
knowing how bad the steak is , i ordered the shrimp .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ times worse than the steak .[ENDSTRING]3
hell , even the courier cafe in urbana has a better salad bar ![ENDSTRING]3
disgusting .[ENDSTRING]3
not much flavor , and not a high quality meat .[ENDSTRING]3
and if that does n't work ask `` what restaurant is your favorite ? ''[ENDSTRING]3
first time out of maybe a hundred i did n't get a good recommendation .[ENDSTRING]3
the salad bar was the only redeeming quality .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ bucks before the tip .[ENDSTRING]3
this is not that kind of place , although it thinks it is .[ENDSTRING]3
the menu offers three options : ribeye , chicken , or shrimp .[ENDSTRING]3
i do n't mean to trash this place too much though .[ENDSTRING]3
the ribeye said it was no problem .[ENDSTRING]3
you can get a mediocre steak for a lot less .[ENDSTRING]3
the steaks are ok , but thin for the price and always overcooked .[ENDSTRING]3
the shrimp is ok , too .[ENDSTRING]3
i am only halfway joking .[ENDSTRING]3
even with the full house we did not have a long wait .[ENDSTRING]3
i ordered a _num_ oz .[ENDSTRING]3
ribeye rare with sauted mushrooms and loaded baked potato .[ENDSTRING]3
so ordered the _num_ oz .[ENDSTRING]3
they were not bad , but they were not sauted .[ENDSTRING]3
steak was below average and service was lacking .[ENDSTRING]3
i try to avoid them as much as possible .[ENDSTRING]3
they could n't even offer anything else ![ENDSTRING]3
... ... ... .[ENDSTRING]3
once again , a terrible experience .[ENDSTRING]3
unfortunately we had a gift certificate .[ENDSTRING]3
i will happily spend that money elsewhere .[ENDSTRING]3
never even came out of his hole in the back .[ENDSTRING]3
i do not recommend renting from u group at all .[ENDSTRING]3
they were extremely rude when my roommate and i called them .[ENDSTRING]3
maintenance is terrible ![ENDSTRING]3
the leasing manager is terribly rude and the staff is clueless ![ENDSTRING]3
avoid ![ENDSTRING]3
avoid ![ENDSTRING]3
when i opened the door the stench was overpowering .[ENDSTRING]3
it smelled like the last tenant was someone with _num_ cats .[ENDSTRING]3
and that was nothing compared to the fact it was so so dirty .[ENDSTRING]3
i spent saturday night in a smelly apartment with no power .[ENDSTRING]3
horrible apartments and management .[ENDSTRING]3
