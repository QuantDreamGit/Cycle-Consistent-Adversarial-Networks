there are signs talking about energy saving all around .[ENDSTRING]2
airport is very clean and surprisingly big .[ENDSTRING]2
charlotte has always been a great airport .[ENDSTRING]2
very clean and recently updated .[ENDSTRING]2
the tsa is super quick too for security .[ENDSTRING]2
overall a nice airport .[ENDSTRING]2
i was impressed with how clean it was , how airy it appeared .[ENDSTRING]2
this was beautiful and very southern feeling .[ENDSTRING]2
i enjoyed my brief visit .[ENDSTRING]2
it was a nice place to have a layover .[ENDSTRING]2
a nice airport with lots of great dining options .[ENDSTRING]2
this airport is pretty modern and has a lot of daily traffic .[ENDSTRING]2
the rocking chairs add a nice , welcoming touch ![ENDSTRING]2
this airport is a pleasant surprise .[ENDSTRING]2
i found this airport to be very clean and modern .[ENDSTRING]2
they have free wifi , which is a bonus .[ENDSTRING]2
great airport .[ENDSTRING]2
does enough to build a pleasant experience .[ENDSTRING]2
maybe i will be able to update when i spend more time ... lol ![ENDSTRING]2
one one or two accounts other airlines and it was still pretty good .[ENDSTRING]2
lately the sides have been awful .[ENDSTRING]3
the okra and casserole were cold .[ENDSTRING]3
it was the same casserole but now was steaming hot and tasteless .[ENDSTRING]3
that in my opinion is really poor customer service .[ENDSTRING]3
it 's hit or miss and i am getting tired of it .[ENDSTRING]3
no big deal there .[ENDSTRING]3
strike _num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
with two steaks sent back , i 'm not exactly getting the royal treatment .[ENDSTRING]3
my coke was empty .[ENDSTRING]3
i think this breaks a record for me .[ENDSTRING]3
never has it ever taken this many attempts to get it right .[ENDSTRING]3
the steak was kinda ... meh ... not great nor bad .[ENDSTRING]3
there was n't a good steak flavor as i 'd expect from a restaurant .[ENDSTRING]3
the baked potato was delivered piping hot .[ENDSTRING]3
all in all , i 'm quite a bit disappointed with this visit .[ENDSTRING]3
probably not soon .[ENDSTRING]3
i 'll stick with something i normally get like fried chicken or pot roast .[ENDSTRING]3
do not go to this restaurant if you are a person of color .[ENDSTRING]3
learn from my errors , find somewhere else for your small engine repair work .[ENDSTRING]3
i went on-line and bought the replacement parts for _num_ bucks .[ENDSTRING]3
anyway skip this place for service they clearly do n't want oil change business .[ENDSTRING]3
not really a `` farm '' person .[ENDSTRING]3
i had purchased tires here a year prior to my most recent visit .[ENDSTRING]3
never heard back even though i followed up twice .[ENDSTRING]3
do not bring your vehicle to farm & fleet .[ENDSTRING]3
ordered one thing online and they shipped a completely different product .[ENDSTRING]3
avoid at all cost ![ENDSTRING]3
still no chairs .[ENDSTRING]3
supposedly they are ordered .[ENDSTRING]3
still nothing from the store .[ENDSTRING]3
no call .[ENDSTRING]3
no replacement furniture .[ENDSTRING]3
not a kid friendly location .[ENDSTRING]3
then , i spent another few weeks waiting for a call back .[ENDSTRING]3
the service is awful and you will often receive things you did n't order .[ENDSTRING]3
the pizza was pretty bland , despite a hefty helping of oregano .[ENDSTRING]3
there is very little sauce , fairly dry cheese , and a chewy crust .[ENDSTRING]3
the small salad was n't their best .[ENDSTRING]3
the service sucked .[ENDSTRING]3
the waitress did n't give us refills and nothing was clean .[ENDSTRING]3
she gave us our check but never came back to take our money .[ENDSTRING]3
i will not be back because of the horrible service .[ENDSTRING]3
i could n't believe what i was hearing .[ENDSTRING]3
wo n't make this mistake again .[ENDSTRING]3
i like other much cheaper pizza than this .[ENDSTRING]3
the location is literally _num_ miles from the house .[ENDSTRING]3
should not take this long to replace an item .[ENDSTRING]3
going to just go to the store for refund of the sauce and bread .[ENDSTRING]3
within a month they have messed up _num_ of our pizzas .[ENDSTRING]3
our waitress was rude and did t want to fix the issue .[ENDSTRING]3
avoid this place at all costs ![ENDSTRING]3
i would suggest picking up your order instead of delivery .[ENDSTRING]3
there was an additional location listed for champaign which turns out to be closer .[ENDSTRING]3
the pizza was barely warmer than room temperature .[ENDSTRING]3
i 'm really not sure how this place has gotten such high ratings .[ENDSTRING]3
the complementary breakfast is not good .[ENDSTRING]3
i 've been staying here over a month due to my job .[ENDSTRING]3
this has been over a month of getting breakfast .[ENDSTRING]3
no luck with calling for any help in complaint .[ENDSTRING]3
ownership does n't seem to care .[ENDSTRING]3
will go elsewhere next time .[ENDSTRING]3
their hours stink .[ENDSTRING]3
are you freakin ' kidding me ?[ENDSTRING]3
you wo n't be doing it this sunday .[ENDSTRING]3
so one afternoon , stopped by to eat a chicken teriyaki sandwich .[ENDSTRING]3
this has been the worst haircut experience of my life .[ENDSTRING]3
spend a little bit more money and save yourself the trouble and disappointment .[ENDSTRING]3
this is the worst place and the worst stuff i have ever met .[ENDSTRING]3
never ever go this place again .[ENDSTRING]3
this might have been the worst hair cut i have ever had .[ENDSTRING]3
inches off of my hair .[ENDSTRING]3
i am very very very unhappy .[ENDSTRING]3
there were to my knowledge _num_ employees in the salon doing nothing .[ENDSTRING]3
i was wrong .[ENDSTRING]3
clearly they do n't want my business ![ENDSTRING]3
very disappointed and hurt that my business was not accepted here .[ENDSTRING]3
overpriced and never again especially for female haircuts .[ENDSTRING]3
she told me no .[ENDSTRING]3
completely incompetent staff .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ classes are where learning goes to die .[ENDSTRING]3
the weather here is horrible .[ENDSTRING]3
unfortunately they did not maintain high standards .[ENDSTRING]3
but some should be avoided completely .[ENDSTRING]3
after my first order from this place i would n't dare order again .[ENDSTRING]3
i ca n't believe there are so many positive reviews of this place .[ENDSTRING]3
never ordering from this place again .[ENDSTRING]3
but i was n't in the mood for meat .[ENDSTRING]3
bland , boring , and worst of all , super greasy .[ENDSTRING]3
now that 's what i call mediocre ![ENDSTRING]3
i 'm not a snob when it comes to chinese food at all .[ENDSTRING]3
cons : decor was sort of confusing and borderline gross .[ENDSTRING]3
the biggest con , however ?[ENDSTRING]3
the egg roll was disappointing .[ENDSTRING]3
it used to be good .[ENDSTRING]3
but today the barista made me so mad ![ENDSTRING]3
it 's like a sunday evening and there 's seriously no one here .[ENDSTRING]3
it 's not like i took a long time deciding what i wanted .[ENDSTRING]3
really , the worst of the espresso locations on campus .[ENDSTRING]3
the coffee here is atrocious .[ENDSTRING]3
cup of flavorless grey water .[ENDSTRING]3
third strike , you 're out ![ENDSTRING]3
i 've given this place three opportunities to _num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
ick .[ENDSTRING]3
sick .[ENDSTRING]3
starbucks became starbucks for a reason .[ENDSTRING]3
i do n't know what to say .[ENDSTRING]3
it 's just milk , dude .[ENDSTRING]3
the drinks , like everything else there , are overpriced for their quality .[ENDSTRING]3
this place is as expensive as starbucks coffee .[ENDSTRING]3
the only difference is at espresso royal , you get a lower quality cup .[ENDSTRING]3
with the starbucks right down the street it is not worth going here .[ENDSTRING]3
the only day worth visiting is on wednesday because they have one dollar lattes .[ENDSTRING]3
terrible customer service .[ENDSTRING]3
rob you blind at every turn .[ENDSTRING]3
not at all from my experience .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ ) i lost my keys to my apartment .[ENDSTRING]3
they refused , and charged me $ _num_ dollars ![ENDSTRING]3
one lady started working on her while i proceeded to wait another _num_ minutes .[ENDSTRING]3
there 's no organization and it is just ridiculous ![ENDSTRING]3
after using the tools they 've just returned tools to this dirty mug .[ENDSTRING]3
they do not clean their own furniture and floor .[ENDSTRING]3
disgusting .[ENDSTRING]3
this is very strange for me .[ENDSTRING]3
i went to get my nails and toes done and left so unhappy .[ENDSTRING]3
not a lot of nail salons open on sunday here .[ENDSTRING]3
the entire salon and nail stations were disgusting .[ENDSTRING]3
there was a layer of acrylic dust on everything .[ENDSTRING]3
the place was terrible .[ENDSTRING]3
however , i was able to find a few suits to try on .[ENDSTRING]3
she did but her parents did nothing and said nothing .[ENDSTRING]3
i only went in to grab a shirt very quickly .[ENDSTRING]3
it 's a piece of junk .[ENDSTRING]3
the only thing you can use this worthless coupon on is their junk .[ENDSTRING]3
the bulbs are n't hot , and the customer service was poor .[ENDSTRING]3
it was not worth fighting campus traffic to get there .[ENDSTRING]3
we rented a truck online and had our confirmation email and receipt with us .[ENDSTRING]3
not helpful .[ENDSTRING]3
needless to say , this business ranks among the most poorly run in town .[ENDSTRING]3
i ordered a _num_ ' truck with no extras for my move .[ENDSTRING]3
this place is awful ![ENDSTRING]3
the employees are either dumb or just do n't give a shit .[ENDSTRING]3
they 're unorganized and totally clueless .[ENDSTRING]3
i have never used a business so poorly run .[ENDSTRING]3
or maybe they 're all this bad .[ENDSTRING]3
terrible .[ENDSTRING]3
also , the boxes that i bought there fell apart .[ENDSTRING]3
this location is weird .[ENDSTRING]3
their customer service is terrible .[ENDSTRING]3
this is unacceptable .[ENDSTRING]3
this place needs at least two more employees , and better customer service .[ENDSTRING]3
it 's fine but such a hassle for a $ _num_ rental .[ENDSTRING]3
it ends up costing me around _num_ minutes .[ENDSTRING]3
he made no effort to reach a resolution .[ENDSTRING]3
terribly slow .[ENDSTRING]3
terrible service .[ENDSTRING]3
other locations do much better than this one , it 's a shame really .[ENDSTRING]3
did n't even get to try it .[ENDSTRING]3
that 's not what i got .[ENDSTRING]3
my time was absolutely wasted .[ENDSTRING]3
cheap drinks .[ENDSTRING]3
one of your few redeeming qualities is that you have bass on tap .[ENDSTRING]3
hate this bar .[ENDSTRING]3
the only good time to go is when it 's nearly empty .[ENDSTRING]3
i do n't get why people go here just for the wings .[ENDSTRING]3
i 've had bad times at brothers .[ENDSTRING]3
it gets too crowded to play darts .[ENDSTRING]3
guard your jacket unless you want a free drink spilled on it .[ENDSTRING]3
it seems to be totally random .[ENDSTRING]3
never wasting my time at brother 's again .[ENDSTRING]3
my ears hurt more than anywhere else i 've been .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ ) never enough space .[ENDSTRING]3
disgusting .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ ) hot as hell .[ENDSTRING]3
you 'll be sweating just standing there even in the middle of winter .[ENDSTRING]3
the fans on the ceiling are useless .[ENDSTRING]3
more like a sports bar and super crowded and not really relaxing .[ENDSTRING]3
have no place to stand or sit .[ENDSTRING]3
also , the dj 's are inept .[ENDSTRING]3
the buzz - only reason this is getting _num_ stars .[ENDSTRING]3
i would avoid this company at all costs ![ENDSTRING]3
please avoid this company at all costs .[ENDSTRING]3
on top of that these people are condescending assholes .[ENDSTRING]3
do not use these people , they are terrible .[ENDSTRING]3
i was disappointed with crispy tofu that is not as good as before .[ENDSTRING]3
my boyfriend was a little annoyed since he had gotten something completely different .[ENDSTRING]3
it was very salty and unpleasant .[ENDSTRING]3
i felt disgusted that i actually ate half since i was so hungry .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ ) a combination of number _num_ and _num_ .[ENDSTRING]3
never again stay away from this place ![ENDSTRING]3
i 've never experienced this type of service before - or lack there of .[ENDSTRING]3
there was n't a lot of options , only about _num_ items .[ENDSTRING]3
both of which were disappointing ![ENDSTRING]3
the shrimp crepe only had two small pieces of shrimp .[ENDSTRING]3
around $ _num_ to share _num_ dishes .[ENDSTRING]3
but now it 's barely passable .[ENDSTRING]3
their fried rice is all gummy and their noodle soups are too salty .[ENDSTRING]3
it was a very disappointing .[ENDSTRING]3
in my opinion , that is way too long for an hour lunch break .[ENDSTRING]3
we walked in and it was very hectic .[ENDSTRING]3
_num_ minutes had gone by and nothing .[ENDSTRING]3
